1. **0 - 1 Knapsack Problem**  [ Solution ](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/0%20-%201%20Knapsack%20Problem)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/) 
```
You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item.
In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

2. **Subset Sum Problem** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Subset%20Sum%20Problem)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/)
```
Given a set of numbers, check whether it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is same or not.
```
3. **Equal Sum Partition** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Equal%20Sum%20Partition)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-problem-dp-18/)
```
Partition problem is to determine whether a given set can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is same.
```
4. **Count of subsets sum with a Given sum** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/tree/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions)


* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-of-subsets-with-sum-equal-to-x/)
```
Given an array arr[] of length N and an integer X, the task is to find the number of subsets with sum equal to X.
