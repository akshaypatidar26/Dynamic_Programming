1. **0 - 1 Knapsack Problem**  [ Solution ](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/0%20-%201%20Knapsack%20Problem)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/) 
```
You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item.
In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or don’t pick it (0-1 property).

2. **Subset Sum Problem** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Subset%20Sum%20Problem)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/)
```
Given a set of numbers, check whether it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is same or not.
```
3. **Equal Sum Partition** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Equal%20Sum%20Partition)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-problem-dp-18/)
```
Partition problem is to determine whether a given set can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is same.
```
4. **Count of subsets sum with a Given sum** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/tree/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions)


* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-of-subsets-with-sum-equal-to-x/)
```
Given an array arr[] of length N and an integer X, the task is to find the number of subsets with sum equal to X.
```
5. **Sum of subset differences** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Sum%20of%20subset%20differences)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-a-set-into-two-subsets-such-that-the-difference-of-subset-sums-is-minimum/)
```
Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) – sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

6. **Unbounded Knapsack** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Unbounded%20Knapsack)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unbounded-knapsack-repetition-items-allowed/)
```
Given a knapsack weight W and a set of n items with certain value vali and weight wti, we need to calculate minimum amount that could make up this quantity exactly. This is different from classical Knapsack problem, here we are allowed to use unlimited number of instances of an item.
```
7. **Coin Change** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Coin%20Change)
* [Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coin-change-dp-7/)
```
Given a value N, find the number of ways to make change for N cents, if we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins. The order of coins doesn’t matter.
```

8. **Longest Common Subsequence** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Longest%20Common%20Subsequence)
* [Problem](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-common-subsequence/0 )
``` 
Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. Both the strings are of uppercase.
```

* [Problem](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/0)
```
Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of the smallest string which has both, str1 and str2 as its sub-sequences.

```
11. **Minimum number of deletions and insertions** [Solution](https://github.com/akshaypatidar26/Dynamic_Programming/blob/master/Dynamic-Programming-Solutions/Minimum%20number%20of%20deletions%20and%20insertions)
* [Problem](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-number-of-deletions-and-insertions/0)
```

Given two strings ‘str1’ and ‘str2’ of size m and n respectively. The task is to remove/delete and insert minimum number of characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.

```
